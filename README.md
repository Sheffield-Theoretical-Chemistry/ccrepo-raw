The correlation consistent basis sets from [ccRepo](http://www.grant-hill.group.shef.ac.uk/ccrepo/index.html) as a single text file in the historical GBASIS format.

## File format

The GBASIS format is explained via the following example.

Element\:Basis_set_name\:\(primitives\) -> \[contracted functions\]\
Max_angular_momentum\
Angular_momentum No_of_prims No_contracted\
Exponent1 Contraction1Coeff1 Contraction2Coeff1 Contraction3Coeff1 ...\
Exponent2 Contraction1Coeff2 Contraction2Coeff2 Contraction3Coeff2 ...\
Exponent3 Contraction1Coeff3 Contraction2Coeff3 Contraction3Coeff3 ...

Hence, the basis set information is organised by angular momentum, then column-wise.

## Acknowledging usage

If you use this information in your research, please consider citing the [ccRepo website](http://www.grant-hill.group.shef.ac.uk/ccrepo/index.html) as part of your paper.

You should also cite the original literature detailing the basis sets you use. A [full bibliography](http://www.grant-hill.group.shef.ac.uk/ccrepo/bib.html) can be found on ccRepo to help with this.
